<p>WSO2 API Manager is a complete solution for publishing APIs, creating and managing a developer community, and for scalably routing API traffic. It leverages proven, production-ready, integration, security and governance components from WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus, WSO2 Identity Server, and WSO2 Governance Registry. Moreover, it is powered by WSO2 Business Activity Monitor, thereby making WSO2 API Manager ready for any large-scale deployments right away.</p>
<p>As part of its latest release, the REST API was developed as a CXF REST web application running on WSO2 API Manager. This API comes with a pluggable security mechanism. Since API security is implemented as a CXF handler, if you need to plug a custom security mechanism, you can write your own handler and add it to the web service. This REST API is implemented based on REST best practices and specifications. API development is started with a swagger specification for Store and Publisher operations.</p>
